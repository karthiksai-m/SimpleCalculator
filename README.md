It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with safe input handling.



###### \ Features

\- Division by zero is handled safely.

\- Modular design with a separate `CalculatorApp` class for calculations.



###### \ How to Run



1\. Clone or download this repository.

2\. Open the project in Visual Studio.

3\. Build and run the `Simple\_Calculator` project.

###### \ Notes



\- `num1` and `num2` are used as the input variable names.

\- `.csproj` and `.sln` files are included so the project can be opened and built in Visual Studio.

\- Temporary files like `bin/` and `obj/` are ignored via `.gitignore`.
